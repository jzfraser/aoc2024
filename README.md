# Advent of Code 2024
This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024.

I will likely implement these in various languages, but I am starting with Go.

## Running the Code
For the go solutions, make sure that you have Go installed (mine is version 1.24.4 at the time of writing).

Create a new directory at the root of the repo named `inputs`, and put your input files into it.
Name each one "day{n}input.txt", where {n} is replaced with the respective day number. This will allow the code to find the files.

Then, hop into your terminal of choice, navigate to aoc2024/Go/ and run the following:
```bash
go run .
```

You can then enter the number of the day you want to run, and it will execute the solution for that day.
This will print out the results for both parts of the day's challenge.
