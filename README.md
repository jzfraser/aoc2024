# Advent of Code 2024
This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024.

I will likely implement these in various languages, but I am starting with Go.

## Running the Code
For the go solutions, make sure that you have Go installed (mine is version 1.24.4 at the time of writing).

Then, hop into your terminal of choice and run the following:
```bash
go run main.go
```

You can then enter the number of the day you want to run, and it will execute the solution for that day.
This will print out the results for both parts of the day's challenge.
